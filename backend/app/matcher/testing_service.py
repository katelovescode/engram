# hammers the `/login` endpoint (throttled harder than data endpoints) and
# triggers 429s long before the daily download quota is touched. We log in
# once per process and reuse the client. Quota tracking lives alongside
# because the library updates ``client.user_downloads_remaining`` as a side
# effect of ``login()``, ``user_info()``, and ``download()`` — reading the
# attribute is free, no extra API call.
#
# All this state lives on a single ``_OS`` dataclass instance instead of
# loose module globals. ``global`` declarations confuse static analyzers
# (CodeQL flagged the writes as "unused global variable" because it does
# not track read-then-write-across-calls through the ``global`` keyword);
# attribute access on a single object reads as a plain "is referenced" and
# also reduces top-of-module noise.
