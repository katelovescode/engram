"""Unit tests for build_subtitle_cache helpers.

The build script is a long-running entry point that's hard to test end-to-end
without burning a real OpenSubtitles quota — these tests cover the pure
helpers (RunTally), the _harvest_show contract (mutates tally in place,
calls on_season_done), and a full round-trip of main() with subtitle harvest
mocked: pre-staged SRTs → main() → tarball + manifest → load through
EpisodeMatcher → match. The round-trip catches drift between what the script
produces and what the consumer expects (manifest schema, tarball layout,
vectorizer config identity).
