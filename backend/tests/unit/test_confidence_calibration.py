"""Unit tests for episode-match confidence calibration.

The matcher's raw ``ranked_voting_score`` is a TF-IDF cosine magnitude
(~0.15-0.21 even for a correct match) and is uninterpretable as a percentage.
``calibrate_confidence`` translates the raw signals (separation, consensus,
normalized score, processed coverage) into a 0-1 confidence that a human
reviewer can read. These tests pin that behavior, anchored to real
Arrested Development S1 matcher runs.

Real AD S1 runs (from ~/.engram/engram.log), all CORRECT matches that
previously displayed as ~18%:

    Episode  raw_score  score_gap  votes/samples
    S01E13   0.165      0.1652     8/10
    S01E12   0.180      0.1795     5/10
    S01E14   0.180      0.1804     4/10

In every case score_gap == score (top2 == 0): the winner swept the field.
