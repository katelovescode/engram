"""Build the precomputed subtitle-vector cache shipped with Engram.

Harvests subtitles for the most-voted TV shows on TMDB, reduces each episode to a
HASHED TF-IDF vector (no readable vocabulary -- see app/matcher/vectorizer_config),
discards the raw SRT, and packages the vectors into a `.tar.gz` plus a manifest
for hosting on GitHub Releases.

Usage (from backend/):
    uv run python scripts/build_subtitle_cache.py --limit 300
    uv run python scripts/build_subtitle_cache.py --shows "The Expanse,Arrested Development"
    uv run python scripts/build_subtitle_cache.py --show-list scripts/curated_shows.csv

TMDB / OpenSubtitles credentials are read from the AppConfig DB row; in CI they
are bootstrapped from the env vars TMDB_API_KEY, OPENSUBTITLES_API_KEY,
OPENSUBTITLES_USERNAME, OPENSUBTITLES_PASSWORD.
