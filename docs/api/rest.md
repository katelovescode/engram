## History & Analytics

### Job History

```
GET /api/jobs/history?page=1&per_page=20&content_type=tv&state=completed
```

Returns all completed/failed jobs with pagination and filtering. Jobs appear in history automatically when they reach a terminal state — no manual clearing required.

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `page` | int | 1 | Page number (1-indexed) |
| `per_page` | int | 20 | Results per page (max 100) |
| `content_type` | string | — | Filter: `tv` or `movie` |
| `state` | string | — | Filter: `completed` or `failed` |

### Job Statistics

```
GET /api/jobs/stats
```

Returns aggregated analytics: total jobs, completed/failed counts, TV/movie counts, average processing time, top 5 common errors, and 10 most recent jobs.

## Review

### Submit Review

```
POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/review
```

Submit a review decision for a title that needs human intervention.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "title_id": 1,
  "episode_code": "S01E01",
  "edition": null
}
```

### Approve All

```
POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/approve-all
```

Approve all pending review items and continue processing.

### `POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/titles/{title_id}/llm-match`

Run the LLM episode matcher for a single title and persist the suggestion to `match_details.llm_suggestion`. Requires `ai_episode_matching_enabled` and the job to have a known `detected_title` + `detected_season`.

**Response (200):**

```json
{
  "suggestion": {
    "episode": 7,
    "confidence": 0.93,
    "reasoning": "Mentions of named character and unique plot beat.",
    "runner_up": {"episode": 6, "confidence": 0.12},
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"
  },
  "reason": null
}
```

When no suggestion is available (feature disabled, no transcript, no synopses, AI returned zero confidence, or any internal error), `suggestion` is `null` and `reason` describes why (`"no_suggestion"`, `"cached"`, or `"internal_error"`). On a cached hit (the suggestion was already computed for this title), the existing suggestion is returned with `reason: "cached"` to avoid duplicate Whisper transcription.
